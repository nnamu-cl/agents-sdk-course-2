Given that I'm traveling for a conference and need a quiet space for preparation, this is concerning.\n\nIs it possible to get assistance with either:\n1. Finding a comparable alternative in the same area\n2. Getting a refund so I can book elsewhere\n\nI appreciate your help with this matter.\n\nBest regards,\n[Your Name]",
